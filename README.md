This react app imitates a popular online card game.

Rules:

1. Player cards cannot attack the turn they come into play
2. A card in play can only attack once per turn
3. The player wins when the AI's hitpoints are reduced to zero. The player loses if they reach 0 hit points

At the moment, the AI targeting logic is very basic. Better targeting that allows the AI to make smart plays will be introduced in the future, as will the ability for the AI to place new cards in play.
